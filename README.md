This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie reviews dataset, a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to classify each review as either positive or negative based on its content. The workflow includes text preprocessing techniques such as lowercasing, stopword removal, and tokenization, followed by feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization. A logistic regression model is then trained on the processed data to perform binary classification. The model achieves strong accuracy and balanced performance on the test data, demonstrating effective use of classical machine learning techniques for text classification tasks.
